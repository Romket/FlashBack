# FlashBack
A fast, lightweight, and highly customizeable command line backup software designed to connect multiple linux/unix systems to a central server.

This is a project born out of necessity. I lost access to my laptop about a month ago, and I had no backup software installed. Thankfully, I was able to get all my important files off, but it was still stressful. After looking into currently available backup software, nothing seemed to match my needs.

**NOTE: FLASHBACK IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!**
